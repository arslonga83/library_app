# library_app

There was a lot to figure out in this one! I wound up using 'new' instead of 'object.create' for collecting the new books because it is just more clear to me how that is working at this point. I figured out how to collect the book info with a popup form, and get the data from it by using 'preventdefault' to keep the form from actually submitting. I left some console.tables in the code to show that what is printed on the screen actually matches the myLibrary array.

I tried to get some CSS practice too, including a background image and custom font, flex alligned table cells, button styling, and custom checkboxes.

The last thing I added was a popup confirmation before executing the delete function.
