# library_app

There was a lot to figure out in this one! I wound up using 'new' instead of 'object.create' for collecting the new books because it is just more clear to me how that is working at this point. I figured out how to collect the book info with a popup form, and get the data from it by using 'preventdefault' to keep the form from actually submitting. I left some console.tables in the code to show that what is printed on the screen actually matches the myLibrary array.

I tried to get some CSS practice too, including a background image and custom font, flex alligned table cells, and button styling. I thought about custom checkbox but I'm not sure I want to take the time to figure that out right now. There is also an annoying flickering of the background image when the table reloads that I might try to research. At this point I do think I solved the main points of the exercise though, and I know we may come back to this later in the course...
